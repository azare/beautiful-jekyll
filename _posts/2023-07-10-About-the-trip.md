On February 25, 2022 my mother lost her short battle with Stage 4 Lung Cancer. My father passed away 2 months prior to her from complications from COPD. Since the time of their death I’ve picked back up my love for motorcycling and discovered that I enjoy long solo motorcycle camping trips. This trip is to continue stepping out of my comfort zone and push my physical and mental abilities. And what a better cause than to raise money for the American Lung Association as I continue my journey.

## Overview

The trip route planning has changed several times over the past 6 months. Some because I've discovered new areas I'd like to see, others influenced by the wild fires in Canada. It's highly probably it will change slightly again along the trip as I adapt to changing weather conditions and experiences I find along the route.

Stage 1 - On Sunday, July 23, 2023 I'll begin this journey from Miami, FL as I ride south to Key West for the official starting location. From there I'll ride north through the midwest states, through Canada heading towards Hyder, AK, riding up the Cassiar Highway towards Fairbanks, AK where I'll get on the Dalton Highway, a desolate road (the term “road” used loosely!) that runs 414 miles from just north of Fairbanks to just south of the Arctic Ocean in the oil fields of Deadhorse (Pruhdoe Bay), AK. It's known as one of the worlds most deadliest roads.

Stage 2 - After resting for a few hours I'll ride back down the Dalton Highway through Fairbanks then head towards Tok, AK. I'll head over the Top of the World Highway towards the Dempster Highway to my stage 2 destination of Tuktoyaktuk, Northwest Territories, CA where I'll ride out to the Arctic Ocean and take a quick swim.

Stage 3 - After spending the night in Tuktoyaktuk I'll begin the journey home heading south towards Jasper and Banff National Parks eventually working my way back down to the lower 48 and head towards Key West, FL to officially complete my trip.

The total trip shuold take around 5 weeks and cover over 14,000 miles.
