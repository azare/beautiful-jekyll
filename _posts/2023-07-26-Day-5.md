After my morning coffee and breakfast I took photos with my Bunk a Biker hosts and said our goodbyes. I’d stop for gas and then head to Devil’s Tower. I got an early start so I was there before the park got crowded and the afternoon heat would arrive.

The day would end at 7pm when I arrived at Lionel's home...my Bunk a Biker host in Great Falls, MT.

Day 5 mileage was 589 miles.
