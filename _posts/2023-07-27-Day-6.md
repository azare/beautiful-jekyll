![Starting Day 4]({{ site.url }}/assets/img/2023/UCCI/day2-start-home.jpeg){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

After my morning coffee and breakfast I took photos with my Bunk a Biker hosts and said our goodbyes. I’d stop for gas and then head to Devil’s Tower. I got an early start so I was there before the park got crowded and the afternoon heat would arrive.


Day 5 would end when I arrived at my Bunk a Biker host in Great Falls, MT.

Day 5 mileage was 390 miles.
