I'm a huge dog lover and at day 6 I was missing my little Okie. Thankfully my hosts dog, Harley, loved spending time with me. He hung out with me and ended up staying in my room for the night. He was a cute old guy.

I was so excited to enter Canada on this day I got up early was ready to hit the road at 6am. As I drove off to the gas station I suddenly remembered I removed the memory card from my dashcam the night before. And instead of putting the cameras memory card protective cover back on, I left it on top of the dashcam. BIG mistake!!!

I forgot to put the memory card back in it that morning so I rode off with the cover sitting on my bike. I ended up spending the next hour walking up and down the road retracing my path searching for it. The camera would be ruined if I could not located it.

FINALLY I was able to locate it not too far from my starting location.

Heading north through Montana on my way to the US/Canadian border, the winds were very strong. This also made it pretty chilly. I decided to pull over on the freeway to put on my rain jacket to help block the wind. As I was putting the jacket on an enormous gust of wind came through and pushed me back into my motorcycle and we both went tumbling over. Thankfully it was still early in the morning and I was well rested. Becausee trying to deadlive a loaded motorcycle that weighed almost 1000 lbs is not easy.

Once I got back on the road, about a mile up the freeway there was a semi that had flipped over because of the high gust that came though. Those are no joke!

Crossing the US/Canadian border was a breeze and they were very friendly and curous about my attempting to ride all the way to the Arctic Ocean. They wished me luck and away I went.

After crossing the border I headed to the small town of Lethbridge. I researched it while planning my route and they have a large Japanese Gardens located there. The grounds were very beautiful and it was a nice place to walk around and stretch my legs for a while.
