Exciting News! 🚨🏍️

I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve been selected as a rider for the @hokaheychallenge 2026! 🎉 

My rider number is #1301, and I’m honored to join other elite long-distance riders in this incredible journey.

## The Challenge:
* Begins August 2, 2026 from Woodstock, IL
* 10,000 miles of adventure across the U.S.
* No GPS allowed--just rally maps provided at the start of the challenge!
* Sleep under the stars with your bike by your side - No hotels!.
* Riding an American V-Twin motorcycle.

### The Cause: 
This challenge isn’t just about the ride; it’s also about raising awareness for social issues affecting indigenous communities.

### Fundraising: 
While we can’t start fundraising until January 1, 2026, I’m using this time to set up my fundraising site and connect with sponsors.

### Dedication: 
I’m dedicating this ride to my parents, who I lost in 2021 and 2022. 

### Fundraising: 
I’m in the process of selecting a charity I’lll be raising money for.
