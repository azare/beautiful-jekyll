Exciting News! 🚨🏍️

I’m thrilled to announce that I’ve been selected as a rider for the 2026 Hoka Hey Motorcycle Challenge&trade;! 🎉 

My rider number is #1301, and I’m honored to join other elite long-distance riders in this incredible journey.

## The Challenge:
* Begins August 2, 2026 from Woodstock, IL
* 10,000+ miles of adventure across the U.S.
* No GPS allowed--just rally maps provided at the start of the challenge!
* Sleep under the stars with your bike by your side - No hotels!.
* Riding an American V-Twin motorcycle.

### The Cause: 
This challenge isn’t just about the ride; it’s also about raising awareness for social issues affecting indigenous communities.

### Fundraising: 
While we can’t start fundraising until January 1, 2026, I’m using this time to set up my fundraising site and connect with sponsors.

### Dedication: 
I’m dedicating this ride to my parents and friends that are no longer with us because of cancer.

### Fundraising: 
I am proud to raise funds for the Child Cancer Fund, a compassionate organization that has provided vital relief to families in Northeast Florida battling childhood cancer for over 30 years, offering support ranging from medical expenses to emotional care.
