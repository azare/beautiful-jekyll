After I had my morning coffee and thanked Troy and Janet for their hospitality and we said our goodbyes.

This day would be a very long, hot, and not very scenic ride for the first half of the day on I-80W. As I got closer to Wall, SD where the famous Wall Drug is located I was getting more excited. That was on my list of places I wanted to visit, which also meant I was getting close to Badlands National Park.

After visiting Wall Drug and get a small snack to eat and water I took of to ride through Badlands National Park. When I arrived it was a blistering 105 degrees outside and I was starting to feel the impact of riding all day in that heat. The Badlands formations were amazing to see in person. I recommend anyone to put this National Park on their list if you’ve not been there before.

Day 4 would end when I arrived at my Bunk a Biker host in Spearfish, SD which is not too far from Sturgis and Devil’s Tower. My hosts were LaVonne and Jeff.

Day 4 mileage was 540 miles.
