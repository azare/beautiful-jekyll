Day 4 for started early and after a morning coffee and thanking Troy and Janet for their hospitality and we said our goodbyes.

After filling up with gas I stopped by Starbucks for the daily meme photo post to the BMW MOA group. The inside joke is people with adventure bikes only use them to ride 10 miles to Starbucks every day.

This day would be a very long, hot, and not very scenic ride for the first half of the day on I-80W. As I got closer to Wall, SD where the famous Wall Drug is located I was getting more excited. That was on my list of places I wanted to visit, which also meant I was getting close to Badlands National Park.

After visiting Wall Drug and get a small snack to eat and water I took of to ride through Badlands National Park. When I arrived it was a blistering 105 degrees outside and I was starting to feel the impact of riding all day in that heat. The Badlands formations were amazing to see in person. I recommend anyone to put this National Park on their list if you’ve not been there before.

The next stop on my way to Spearfish was Mount Rushmore. The rock carvings were a common appearance in history books and during school. Seeing it in person was amazing.

Day 4 would end when I arrived at my Bunk a Biker host in Spearfish, SD which is not too far from Sturgis and Devil’s Tower. My hosts were LaVonne and Jeff.

Day 4 mileage was only 540 miles but the 100+ degree heat made it brutal.
