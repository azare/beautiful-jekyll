I left home around 7:00 DST on July 23 to head to St. Louis. I still needed to complete 1500 within 36 hours so I could claim my Iron Butt 1500. The morning weather was hot and the day would be long and with no relief in sight for the blister heat as I headed northwest.

At 15:46 DST I arrived in Chattanooga, TN after riding the additional 229 miles to complete my Iron Butt - Butt Burner Gold, which is riding 1500 miles in under 36 hours.

Day 2 ended in St. Louis when I arrived at my son’s house at 22:30 CST.

I would take a short break to sleep before I got back on the road the following morning at 10:00 CST.


Ending mileage for Day 2 was 971 miles.
