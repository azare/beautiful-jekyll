I registered for the {: .hh-trademark} ride. They only have opening space for 100 new riders each year, hoping I make the cut!  The ride starts on Aug 2, 2026 in Woodstock, IL…and over 10,000 miles later we’ll finish at the starting line.

Ever since I completed my 2023 Alaska trip I've wanted to push myself even further. The {: .hh-trademark} was an event I learned about while on that trip. I ended up being too late to sign up for the 2024 event, I was going to make sure I didn't miss it for 2026.
