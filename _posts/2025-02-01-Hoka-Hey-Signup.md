I registered for the 2026 Hoka Hey ride. They only had opening space for 100 new riders, hoping I make the cut!  The challenge starts in Aug 2, 2026 in Woodstock, IL…and over 10,000 miles later we’ll finish at the starting line.

Ever since I completed my 2023 Alaska trip I've wanted to push myself even further. The Hoka Hey was a motorcycle challenge I learned about while on that trip. While I ended up being too late to sign up for the 2024 Hoka Hey, I was going to make sure I didn't miss it for 2026.
