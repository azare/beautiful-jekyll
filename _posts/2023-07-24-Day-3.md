I left my son’s house around 10:00 CST and headed to REI to pickup a few camping supplies and then over to Whole Foods for the days food. By 11:00 I was on the road working my way north to Sioux Falls, SD.

The weather wasn't looking great for the day so I needed to plan my route around the rain if possible.

Day 3 ended at 20:20 CST when I arrived to my Bunk a Biker host in Sioux Falls, SD. Troy and Janet were great hosts for the evening and we sat around talking about our travel and all things two wheels.

I turned in early since I’d had a couple of long days on the road with not much sleep.

Day 3 mileage was 801 miles.
