This morning I woke up and had rain for the first 1.5hrs and temps in the upper 40’s.  My heated gear is working great. I have a leak in my Klim helmet visor seal I need to fix. There is nothing worse that water dripping on the inside of your visor, raining and foggy mountain weather, cold and trying to see, oh and a bunch of other drivers around you.

On my way towards Banff I stopped to view the beautiful scenery as the fog was still heavy. I met a friendly Indian family that were visiting the area. They offered to take a photo of me and we also did a group picture. Their kids were in awe of my motorcycle so I let their son sit on it. It was towering over him and he had a huge smile on his face.


I made it to Lake Louise around 10am for my morning coffee shop visit 😊

FINALLY I was able to locate it not too far from my starting location.

Heading north through Montana on my way to the US/Canadian border, the winds were very strong. This also made it pretty chilly. I decided to pull over on the freeway to put on my rain jacket to help block the wind. As I was putting the jacket on an enormous gust of wind came through and pushed me back into my motorcycle and we both went tumbling over. Thankfully it was still early in the morning and I was well rested. Becausee trying to deadlive a loaded motorcycle that weighed almost 1000 lbs is not easy.

Once I got back on the road, about a mile up the freeway there was a semi that had flipped over because of the high gust that came though. Those are no joke!

Crossing the US/Canadian border was a breeze and they were very friendly and curous about my attempting to ride all the way to the Arctic Ocean. They wished me luck and away I went.

After crossing the border I headed to the small town of Lethbridge. I researched it while planning my route and they have a large Japanese Gardens located there. The grounds were very beautiful and it was a nice place to walk around and stretch my legs for a while.

The day would end when I arrived at my hotel in Calgory, AB.

Day 6 mileage was 390 miles.
