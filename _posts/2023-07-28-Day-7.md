This morning I woke up and had rain for the first 1.5hrs and temps in the upper 40’s.  My heated gear is working great. I have a leak in my Klim helmet visor seal I need to fix. There is nothing worse that water dripping on the inside of your visor, raining and foggy mountain weather, cold and trying to see, oh and a bunch of other drivers around you.

On my way towards Banff I stopped to view the beautiful scenery as the fog was still heavy. I met a friendly Indian family that were visiting the area. They offered to take a photo of me and we also did a group picture. Their kids were in awe of my motorcycle so I let their son sit on it. It was towering over him and he had a huge smile on his face.

I made it to Lake Louise around 10am for my morning coffee shop visit 😊

I’m heading to Icefields Parkway now and hopefully make it to Grand Prairie for the night. I don’t know where I’ll stay yet but hopefully one contact will come through with her Bunk-a-biker friend that can host me.  If not I’ll try to get a spot at the camp ground up there.  I think this part will be so much easier once I get into the more remote areas.  I can just wild camp then. 

Now to finish my Maple Canadiano coffee and breakfast and hit the road!
