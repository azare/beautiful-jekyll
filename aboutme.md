This site is a place to share my travel adventures--most of them on my motorcycle, though I expect that will expand to other kinds of travel in the future. The *unpausing* of my life began after losing both of my parents in late 2021 and early 2022. No matter how old you are, losing a parent is always difficult. Their passing made me pause and reflect deeply on my own life and how I was spending my time. I realized I had stopped doing many of the things that once brought me joy. For 25 years, my focus had been on family and raising three children, which left little room for personal passions. Now that my kids are grown, independent, and living their own lives, I’ve found the freedom to rediscover my own.

In early 2022, I rekindled my love for two-wheeled adventures. I traded in my 2006 Harley-Davidson Road Glide for a 2022 BMW R1250GS Adventure--an updated version of one of the first bikes I ever owned as an adult. That year I logged more than 10,000 miles on long-distance rides, each one leaving me hungry for the next journey. During a local BMW club meeting, I listened to a rider describe his trip from Key West to Prudhoe Bay, Alaska. The story inspired me to take on the challenge myself. I spent months researching routes, gear, packing strategies, and the potential risks along the way.

After connecting with others who had completed the journey, I felt ready. I chose to ride solo, embracing the challenge of wild camping as often as possible to push myself beyond my comfort zone. My goal was to camp each night--with a few exceptions for Key West, a stop to visit my son in St. Louis, and a stay in Prudhoe Bay. In total, I ended up camping for half the trip, spent nights in motels or Airbnbs, and stayed with generous Bunk-a-Biker hosts who welcome riders into their homes.

My parents taught me never to fear new experiences or unfamiliar paths. I dedicated this journey to them while raising funds for the American Lung Association in memory of my mother, who passed away on February 25, 2022, after a courageous fight with Stage 4 lung cancer, and my father, who lost his battle with COPD in December 2021. Every mile I ride honors their spirit, their strength, and the sense of adventure they passed on to me.
