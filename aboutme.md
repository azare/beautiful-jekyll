This site is meant to share my travel adventures, primarily on my motorcycle, although I'm sure it will extend to other forms of travel in the future. The unpausing of my life started with the loss of my parents in early 2022. I don't think it matters how old you are; the loss of a parent is always difficult. I started to reflect on my own mortality at that point and took a look at how I was living my life, which led to asking myself why I had stopped doing many of the things I enjoyed so much when I was younger. Well, a lot of the reason was familyâ€”I raised three children over those 25 years and just didn't have the free time. Now my children are all young adults, self-supportive, and leading their own lives. Because of that, I find myself with more free time on my hands.

In early 2022, I rediscovered my love for two-wheeled motorsports. I decided to trade in my 2006 Harley Davidson Road Glide for a 2022 BMW R11250GS Adventure. The adventure bike was one of the first bikes I owned as an adult. During that year, I was fortunate to take many long trips, covering over 10,000 miles. But after coming home from each trip, I missed the feeling of adventure and being out in nature. I started doing research for my next destination, and during a bike club meeting, I attended a talk by a local rider discussing his ride from Key West to Prudhoe Bay, AK with his brother-in-law. That trip seemed like a good way to push my comfort zone further, so I spent the next three months researching the route, points of interest, how to pack and prepare, and what some of the dangers to be prepared for are.

After speaking with others who have done the trip, I felt confident that this was doable for me. I've decided to do the trip solo and maximize wild camping as much as possible to push myself beyond my comfort limits. My goal is to camp every night, with the exception for a stop by my son's house in St. Louis, and possibly near Pruhdoe Bay and Tuktoyaktuk. My parents raised me to never be afraid to try something new and venture to new destinations for adventure. So this trip is also for them and to help raise money for the American Lung Association in honor of my mother, who was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer and lost her battle on Feb 25, 2022, and my father, who passed away on December 15, 2021, due to complications from COPD.
